# Surface-Brightness-Profiles

The codes in this repository were used during a project that I completed in a class called "Astronomical Techniques" at Wellesley College. My lab partner Keiren Burrus and I used Whitlin Observatory's 24 inch telescope to observe four galaxies. That is, NGC - 9646, NGC - 7331, NGC - 205, and M74. Exposures were taken with a charge coupled device (gain 2.6 e-/DN) and were calibrated using the CCD Data Processor tool in a program called AstroImage J. Once all of the images are calibrated, I used SAO DS9 to extract data and move it to an excel sheet for analysis using Python.

The python codes contained were created using jupyter notebook and is reccomended to run and test the code. 

The comments on the code itself are self explanatory in terms of how it operates and what is being generated but for further conceptualization of the project, see the attached paper. For a short summary of the conceptualization see the poster.
