# Surface-Brightness-Profiles

This is a project that was used in the class Astronomic Techniques at Wellesley College. My lab partner Keiren Burrus and I used Whitlin Observatory's 24 inch telescope to observe four galaxies. That is, NGC - 9646, NGC - 7331, NGC - 205, and M74. Pictures of all four galaxies can be found under the "images" file. Exposures were taken with a charge coupled device (gain 2.6 e-/DN) and were calibrated using the CCD Data Processor tool in a program called AstroImage J. Once all of the images are calibrated, I used SAO DS9 to extract data and move it to an excel sheet for analysis using Python. 

The python codes contained were created using jupyter notebook and is reccomended to run the code. 

The comments on the code are self explanatory in terms of data analysis, but for more information on the project itself please see the abstract.
